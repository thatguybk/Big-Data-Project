## Problem Statement:
The United States has been reliant on natural gas as their main source of energy production for many years. We will provide an in-depth analysis of energy production of natural gas vs renewable energy sources to see if renewable energy could have been used from the beginning including the difference between CO2 emissions during natural gas processing.
